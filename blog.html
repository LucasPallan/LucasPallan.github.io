      <h2> Coolest pinball machine ever by supreme </h2>
      <h2 id="date"> 27th of may 2019</h2>
      <div>
         <p> Stern, the leading authority on pinball machines, has partnered with Supreme, the brand responsible for the group of people you least want to encounter at a Yeezy pop-up shop, to bring you a gadget that marries both interests. <br> <br>
            Supreme announced the collaboration through a promo video on its Instagram last night, which shows a sleek, glossy playfield, and the illuminated Supreme box logo everywhere. It also features an LED point screen flashing things like “Multiball is lit,” which I incorrectly presumed was use of popular youth slang, but is actually just a normal pinball term for when multiple balls are in play at once.
