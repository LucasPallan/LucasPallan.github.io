      <h2> Adidas Yeezy V2 350 "Glow" </h2>
      <div>
         <p> 
            Arriving in full family sizes from adult down to infant, the Yeezy 350 “Glow” offers a two-toned Primeknit upper that’s been re-engineered to glow in the dark, and also features the line’s now-standard monofilament side stripe. The bulbous midsole continues the glow-in-the-dark detailing, and as is par for the course with the 350, it’s packed full of comfy and bouncy Boost cushioning to ensure legendary comfort. The smaller-sized pairs utilize all the same materials and construction as their full-sized counterparts, but also add a non-slip rubber outsole to ensure that the kids can stay on their toes. <br> <br>
            The adult pair is priced at $250 USD to allot for its unique light-up stylings, while the kids/infants pairs have been bumped up as well, with the former retailing at $180 USD while the latter arrives at $160 USD.
